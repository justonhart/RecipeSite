## Ingredients
### Crust
* 1 cup graham cracker crumbs
* 1 cup coconut flakes
* 6 Tbsp butter, melted
* 4 Tbsp sugar

### Filling
* 1 can sweetened condensed milk (14 oz)
* 1/2 cup key lime juice
* 3 large egg yolks
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 Tbsp lime zest

## Preparation
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place 12 cupcake liners in a regular sized muffin pan. 
2. Add graham cracker crumbs, coconut, melted butter and sugar in a bowl and stir until combined. Add about three tablespoons of mixture to each baking cup. Press firmly onto bottom and up sides of each cup. Bake until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Set aside but leave oven on. 
3. Whisk together sweetened condensed milk, lime juice, egg yolks, salt, and lime zest until thoroughly combined. Pour mixture evenly into prepared crusts. Bake until pies are set, 12-14 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack, about one hour. Refridgerate for two hours. 
4. Top pies with homemade whipped cream. Garnish with lime slices, toasted coconut or graham cracker crumbs.
