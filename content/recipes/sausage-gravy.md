## Ingredients
- 1 lb pork sausage
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 3 cups whole milk

## Preparation
1. In a large skillet over medium high heat, cook the sausage until brown and crumbly.
2. Sprinkle sausage with flour, stir, and allow to cook for several minutes until the flour can absorb some of the fat and turn golden brown. 
3. Add the milk and stir. Continue stirring occasionally over medium heat until gravy thickens, about 5-10 minutes.
